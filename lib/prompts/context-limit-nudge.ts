CRITICAL WARNING: MAX CONTEXT LIMIT REACHED

You are at or beyond the configured max context threshold. This is an emergency context-recovery moment.

You MUST use the \`compress\` tool now. Do not continue normal exploration until compression is handled.

The tool name is exactly \`compress\` — no prefix, abbreviation, or variation. Include all required argument fields in the call; a misnamed or partial call cannot execute and will be rejected.

If you are in the middle of a critical atomic operation, finish that atomic step first, then compress immediately.

SELECTION PROCESS
Start from older, resolved history and capture as much stale context as safely possible in one pass.
Avoid the newest active working messages unless it is clearly closed.

SUMMARY REQUIREMENTS
Your summary MUST cover all essential details from the selected messages so work can continue.
If the compressed range includes user messages, preserve user intent exactly. Prefer direct quotes for short user messages to avoid semantic drift.
